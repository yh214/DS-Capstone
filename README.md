## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in challenging myself using the Spark machine learning library to analyse sparkify mini data set.
Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It's designated to run on large cluster of computers but it can 
also run on single computer. In this project, the following tasks has been done: 

1. Data exploratory: data cleaning has been performed.
2. Feature extraction: features are generated from the data.
3. Model building and evaluation.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one jupyter notebook containing the process of all tasks. 
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@chrrhyghy/data-analysis-result-for-stackoverflow-2017-data-8fc659ce2a38).
